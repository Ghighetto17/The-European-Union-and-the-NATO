        <h2>The Origins of the EU After World War II</h2>
        <p>
            The origins of the European Union lie in the aftermath of the Second World War. Europe was deeply damaged economically, politically, and socially, and the risk of new conflicts was high. At the same time, the continent was divided by the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union.
            In this context, European countries began to seek cooperation as a way to guarantee peace, stability, and economic recovery. Rather than relying on military power, the goal was to make war between European states not only unthinkable but also economically impossible.
            A decisive moment came on 9 May 1950, when France proposed reconciliation with Germany through cooperation in the production of coal and steel, two key resources for war industries. This proposal, known as the Schuman Declaration, is considered the foundation of European integration and is commemorated today as Europe Day.

        <h2>The First European Communities</h2>
        <p>
            In 1957, six countries — France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg — signed the Treaties of Rome. These treaties established the European Economic Community (EEC), whose main objective was the creation of a common market. This market aimed to ensure the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people among member states.
            At the same time, the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) was created to coordinate civilian nuclear research and promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
            Later, the institutions of the EEC, Euratom, and the European Coal and Steel Community were merged. This institutional unification improved efficiency and simplified decision-making within the European system.

        <h2>Institutional Development and Early Challenges</h2>
        <p>
            As integration progressed, new institutions were strengthened. The European Commission was established to propose legislation and represent the common interest of all member states.
            However, the integration process was not without difficulties. For example, the United Kingdom’s application to join the EEC in 1967 was blocked by France, which feared a loss of influence.
            A significant democratic milestone was reached in 1979, when members of the European Parliament were elected for the first time by universal suffrage, giving citizens direct representation at the European level.
            In 1986, the Single European Act was signed. Its primary aim was to complete the single market by removing remaining barriers to trade and movement within the Community.

        <h2>Political Change and New Opportunities in Europe</h2>
        <p>
            Major geopolitical changes at the end of the 1980s reshaped Europe. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the reunification of Germany had a profound impact on European integration.
            Soon after, the collapse of the Soviet Union opened new opportunities for cooperation with countries in Central and Eastern Europe. These historical developments encouraged European states to pursue deeper political and economic integration.

    <!-- BIRTH OF THE EU -->

    <div class="text">
        <h2>The Birth of the European Union</h2>
        <p>
            The Maastricht Treaty, signed in 1992, officially created the European Union. This treaty expanded EU powers and launched the process of economic and monetary union, including the plan for a common currency.
            The Schengen Agreement was introduced to guarantee freedom of movement, allowing people to travel between participating countries without internal border controls.
            The project of a common currency progressed, leading to the introduction of the Euro, although some countries, such as the United Kingdom and Sweden, chose not to adopt it.

    <div class="text">
        <h2>Enlargement and Treaty Reforms</h2>
        <p>
            The European Union underwent a major enlargement with the accession of ten new countries, mainly from Central and Eastern Europe. All joined fully, except Cyprus, whose northern part remains under Turkish control.
            At the same time, attempts were made to adopt a European Constitution to replace existing treaties. This initiative generated intense debate and was eventually abandoned.
            On 1 January 2007, Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU. In the same year, the Treaty of Lisbon was signed and later entered into force in 2009, improving institutional efficiency and decision-making processes.

        <h2>Economic Crisis and Social Challenges</h2>
        <p>
            The global financial crisis severely affected the Eurozone, creating serious economic difficulties in several countries, particularly Greece. This period tested solidarity among member states and led to reforms in economic governance.
            In 2013, Croatia became the newest EU member. Around the same time, political instability caused by events such as the Arab Spring led to increased migration toward Europe.

        <h2>Migration, Brexit, and Recent Developments</h2>
        <p>
            In 2015, over one million migrants entered the Schengen Area, creating a major migration crisis. This situation divided EU countries and contributed to the rise of nationalist and Eurosceptic political movements.
            In 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU. After lengthy negotiations, Brexit became official on 31 January 2020, making the UK the first country to leave the Union.
            Following Brexit, the EU now consists of 27 member states and continues discussions with new candidate countries. The Schengen Area includes 26 states, with further integration expected.
