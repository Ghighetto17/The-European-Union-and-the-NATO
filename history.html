        <h2>What is the European Union?</h2>
        <p>
            The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union created after the Second World War to
            guarantee peace, stability and cooperation in Europe. After years of conflict and destruction,
            European countries decided to work together instead of competing against each other.
            The process of integration began in the 1950s with cooperation in key industries such as coal and steel
            and later expanded to include economic, political, and social areas.
            Today, the EU is a unique partnership based on shared values and common goals, bringing together
            27 European countries.
