        <h2>The Origins of the EU After World War II</h2>
        <p>
            The origins of the European Union lie in the aftermath of World War 2. Europe was deeply scarred economically, politically and socially, and the risk of new conflicts was high. The continent was also divided by the Cold War. In this context, European countries began to seek cooperation as a way to guarantee peace, stability and recovery.<br>A decisive moment came on May 9 in 1950, when France proposed reconciliation with Germany through cooperation in the production of coal and steel. This proposal, known as the Schuman Declaration, is considered the foundation of European integration and is commemorated today as Europe Day.

        <h2>The First European Communities</h2>
        <p>
            In 1957, six countries (France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) signed the Treaties of Rome. These treaties established the European Economic Community (EEC), whose main objective was the creation of a common market. This market aimed to ensure the free movement of goods, services, capital and people among member states.<br>At the same time, the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) was created to coordinate civilian nuclear research and promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy.<br>Later, the institutions of the EEC, Euratom and the European Coal and Steel Community were merged. This institutional unification improved efficiency and simplified decision-making within the European system.
