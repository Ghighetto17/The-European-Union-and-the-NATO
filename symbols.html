        <h2>The Symbols of the European Union</h2>
        <p>
            The European Union has several official symbols that represent its values, identity, and unity. These symbols are widely recognised across Europe and around the world and help strengthen a shared sense of belonging among European citizens.

    <!-- EU FLAG -->

        <h2>The European Flag</h2>
        <p>
            The European flag consists of a circle of twelve gold stars on a blue background. The stars symbolise the ideals of unity, solidarity, and harmony among the peoples of Europe. The number of stars does not represent the number of EU member states; instead, the circle itself is a symbol of unity and completeness.
            The flag is one of the most recognisable symbols of Europe. It represents both the European Union and, more broadly, the identity of Europe as a whole. It can be seen in many everyday contexts, such as in front of town halls, government buildings, EU institutions, universities, diplomatic representations, and public squares. It also appears on EU-funded projects, humanitarian aid initiatives, passports, euro banknotes, and during international sporting events.

        <h2>The EU Motto: “United in Diversity”</h2>
        <p>
            The official motto of the European Union is “United in diversity”. First introduced in 2000, it expresses the idea that Europeans are united in working together for peace and prosperity while respecting and celebrating their different cultures, traditions, and languages.
            The motto reflects one of the core principles of the EU: cooperation without losing national and cultural identity.

        <h2>Europe Day</h2>
        <p>
            Europe Day is celebrated every year on 9 May. It commemorates the anniversary of the Schuman Declaration, presented on 9 May 1950, which laid the foundations for European integration and the creation of the European Union.
            On Europe Day, EU institutions organise events, activities, and open days that allow citizens to visit the institutions, learn how they function, and better understand the policies that influence everyday life in Europe.

    <!-- EU ANTHEM -->

            <h2>The European Anthem</h2>
            <p>
                The European anthem is based on the melody of “Ode to Joy” from the Ninth Symphony, composed in 1823 by Ludwig van Beethoven. The original poem was written by Friedrich von Schiller in 1785 and expresses an idealistic vision of unity and brotherhood among humanity.
                In 1972, the Council of Europe adopted this melody as its anthem, and in 1985 it was officially adopted by the European Union. The anthem has no lyrics and is purely instrumental, using the universal language of music to convey ideals such as freedom, peace, and solidarity.
                The European anthem does not replace the national anthems of EU member states. Instead, it is played during official EU ceremonies and events with a European character to celebrate shared values.
