        <h2>The Birth of NATO: A Response to Post-War Insecurity</h2>
        <p>
            The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was founded in 1949 in the aftermath of World War II, a conflict that devastated Europe both economically and socially. Tens of millions of people had died, and many countries were left politically fragile and vulnerable.
            At the same time, growing tensions between Western countries and the Soviet Union created a climate of uncertainty. Diplomatic efforts to secure long-term peace, particularly concerning Germany’s future, proved unsuccessful. This situation pushed Western nations to seek a formal alliance that could guarantee mutual security and stability.
            NATO was created by 12 founding countries with the aim of preventing future conflicts through cooperation, shared values, and a collective defense system.

            <h2>Collective Defense and NATO’s Role During the Cold War</h2>
        <p>
            At the core of NATO lies the principle of collective defense, defined in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. It states that an attack against one member is considered an attack against all, requiring a united response.
            During the Cold War, NATO expanded as new members joined, including Greece and Turkey in 1952 and West Germany in 1955. These enlargements strengthened the alliance but also intensified tensions with the Soviet Union, which responded by forming the Warsaw Pact.
            Europe became divided into two opposing blocs, and the period was marked by political rivalry and a nuclear arms race. NATO’s main job during this era was deterrence: preventing conflict by maintaining military readiness and unity among its members.

    <!-- CHANGING SECURITY ENVIRONMENT -->

        <h2>The End of the Cold War and a Changing Security Environment</h2>
        <p>
            By the late 20th century, economic difficulties and political unrest weakened the Soviet Union and its allies. Efforts to reduce global risks included the signing of nuclear non-proliferation agreements aimed at limiting the spread of nuclear weapons.
            In 1989, a wave of revolutions swept across Eastern Europe, symbolized by the fall of the Berlin Wall. Two years later, the Soviet Union collapsed, officially ending the Cold War.
            This historic change raised questions about NATO’s purpose. With its original adversary gone, the alliance needed to redefine its role in a new international context.

    <!-- NATO'S NEW JOB -->
    <section class="eu-intro zoom-section">
    <div class="text">
        <h2>NATO’s New Jobs: Crisis Management and Global Security</h2>
        <p>
            After the Cold War, NATO transformed from a purely defensive alliance into a broader security organization. Its responsibilities expanded to include peacekeeping, crisis management, and conflict prevention.
            NATO played a key role in stabilizing regions affected by war, particularly in the Balkans, through missions in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo. These operations aimed to protect civilians, support peace agreements, and prevent further violence.
            In 2001, following the terrorist attacks in the United States, NATO invoked Article 5 for the first time in its history. This led to a major mission in Afghanistan, highlighting NATO’s growing role in counter-terrorism and international security.

        <h2>NATO in Today’s Society</h2>
        <p>
            In the 21st century, NATO continues to adapt to new and complex threats. The 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia marked a turning point for European security, prompting NATO to reinforce its presence in Eastern Europe and the Baltic States.
            Today, NATO’s jobs include deterrence, defense, crisis response, and cooperation with partner countries. The alliance also addresses modern challenges such as terrorism, cyber threats, regional instability, and geopolitical competition.
            NATO remains a central pillar of international security, promoting cooperation among its members and contributing to stability in an increasingly interconnected and uncertain world.
