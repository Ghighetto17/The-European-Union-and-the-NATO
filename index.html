        <h2>What is the European Union?</h2>
        <p>
            The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union created after the Second World War to
            guarantee peace, stability, and cooperation in Europe. After years of conflict and destruction,
            European countries decided to work together instead of competing against each other.
            The process of integration began in the 1950s with cooperation in key industries such as coal and steel
            and later expanded to include economic, political, and social areas.
            Today, the EU is a unique partnership based on shared values and common goals, bringing together
            27 European countries. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

            The European Union promotes cooperation between its member states by creating common laws and
            policies. One of its main goals is to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital
            within the EU. It also supports economic growth, protects citizens’ rights, and encourages solidarity
            among countries, especially during times of crisis.
            The EU works in many areas, such as trade, education, environmental protection, and security, and it
            continues to evolve to face modern challenges like migration, economic stability, and international
            relations. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
