        <h2>What is the European Union?</h2>
        <p>
            The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union created after World War 2 to guarantee peace, stability and cooperation in Europe. After years of conflict, European countries decided to work together instead of competing against each other.<br>
            The process of integration began in the 50s, it encourages the cooperation in industries such as coal and steel, but it also includes areas like economics and politics.<br>
            Today, the EU is a unique partnership based on shared values and common goals, bringing together 27 countries.

        <h2>What are the values of the EU?</h2>
        <p>
            The European Union is founded on a set of shared values, these are respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights. Together, they form the basis of life within the EU and must be respected by all member states.<br>
            Through these values, the EU protects fundamental freedoms such as equal treatment for all (for example applying laws fairly to everyone). The EU also works to strengthen democratic participation and promote tolerance and solidarity.
