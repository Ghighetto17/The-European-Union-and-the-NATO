        <h2>Purpose and Management of the Euro</h2>
        <p>
            The euro is the official currency of the European Union. It is currently used by 19 of the 27 EU member states, which together form the Eurozone. The use of a single currency allows citizens and businesses to travel, trade, and operate across these countries without the need to exchange money, making economic activities simpler and more efficient.
            The euro was introduced to strengthen economic integration, promote financial stability, and facilitate cooperation among EU countries. It is issued and managed by the European Central Bank, which is headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany. While many EU countries have adopted the euro, some member states, such as Denmark and Poland, have chosen to keep their national currencies.

        <h2>Free Movement Within the EU</h2>
        <p>
            The EU single market is one of the most significant achievements of the European Union. It enables the EU to operate as a single economic area by removing internal barriers between member states.
            Within the single market, the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people is guaranteed. This means that companies can sell products and offer services across borders, professionals can work in other EU countries, and citizens are free to live, study, shop, or retire in any member state.
            The single market promotes competition, increases efficiency, improves product and service quality, and helps reduce prices. It supports economic growth by benefiting consumers and businesses alike.

        <h2>The Schengen Area</h2>
        <p>
            To further support freedom of movement, the Schengen Area was established. It allows people to travel between participating countries without routine border checks or the need for visas.
            The Schengen Area includes most EU member states as well as several non-EU countries, such as Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. For residents and visitors, this system makes travel faster and more convenient, while also encouraging tourism, trade, and cultural exchange across Europe.
